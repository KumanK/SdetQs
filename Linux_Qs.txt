xargs : 
  1.
	xargs is a Unix command which can be used to build and execute commands from standard input
	xargs takes the input from STDIN (which is o/p of a.out executable)


	root@administrator-hmecd000149:/home/kkuman/coding# ./a.out
	file1
	file2
	file3
	file4
	root@administrator-hmecd0009:/home/kkuman/coding# ./a.out | xargs touch
	root@administrator-hmecd000149:/home/kkuman/coding# ls
	a.out  file1  file2  file3  file4  

  2. delete all the .xml files recursively from a folder & all sub folders
   > find /home/kkuman/coding/ -type f -name "*.xml" | xargs rm
