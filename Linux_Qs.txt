> sed 's/foo/koo/' hello.txt       -> for every line of hello.txt first occurance of foo will be replaced with koo

> sed -i 's/foo/koo/' hello.txt    -> for every line of hello.txt first occurance of foo will be replaced with koo in place, hello.txt will be modified -i means in place

> sed -i "s/old/new/g" sample.txt  -> old will become new for every occurance
> sed -i "s/old/new/gI" sample.txt -> OLd, old, Old case sensitive "old" will be replaced

> cat sample.txt | awk "/^new/" -> find the new word in start of line
> awk '{print $1 "\t" $3}' sample.txt -> print first & 3rd word of each line
> awk '/n$/' sample.txt     -> lines end with char n

xargs : 
  1.
	xargs is a Unix command which can be used to build and execute commands from standard input
	xargs takes the input from STDIN (which is o/p of a.out executable)


	root@administrator-hmecd000149:/home/kkuman/coding# ./a.out
	file1
	file2
	file3
	file4
	root@administrator-hmecd0009:/home/kkuman/coding# ./a.out | xargs touch
	root@administrator-hmecd000149:/home/kkuman/coding# ls
	a.out  file1  file2  file3  file4  

  2. delete all the .xml files recursively from a folder & all sub folders
   > find /home/kkuman/coding/ -type f -name "*.xml" | xargs rm
