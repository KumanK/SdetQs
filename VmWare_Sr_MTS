1st Round:
	1. write a requst code for GET requests
		try except finally
		Class code
		status code
		Error types
	2. shell commands:
		sed -> replace Ahmedabad to Mumbai
	3. Python code:
		> longest substring where left and right digit sum is equal
		> middle element should be always odd
		> o/p string length is always odd
		examples:
			1. num = 12321
				o/p = 5 "12 3 21" -> around 3 both sides we have sum =2+1 =3
			2. num = 1237326
				o/p = 5 "23732" is such a string
