1st Round(Tech):
	Recent project:
		> Project discussions
		> what is LDAP ? project question -  Directory comms protocol, get user users persmissiond granted via LDAP
			- To authenticate, the  client sends a bind request to the LDAP server along with the userâ€™s identifier (i.e., username or email) and password, which the client obtains when the user inputs their credentials.
			- LDAP authentication as a cloud-based service
	Framework\scripting:
		> python + selenium, what is preffered way to find out locators ? name / xpaths ?
		> json stringify , JSON loads Vs load
	
		1. write a requst code for GET requests
			try except finally
			Class code
			status code
			Error types
			difference between requests.request and requests.get
		2. list 10 shell commands:
			sed -> replace Ahmedabad to Mumbai in a text file
			
	Python coding:
		> longest substring where left and right digit sum is equal
		> middle element should be always odd
		> o/p string length is always odd
		examples:
			1. num = 12321
				o/p = 5 "12 3 21" -> around 3 both sides we have sum =2+1 =3
			2. num = 1237326
				o/p = 5 "23732" is such a string
		
		Approach Implemented:
			1. travel to the each digit of number
			2. When a digit found odd , jump to routine get_substring()
			3. get_substring() defines a mid , right and left pointers
				> sum the left & right side digits until it is same | we reach to end of right/left side
				
		cons - this approach does not works for input "9817891"

2nd round:
	write a program to read stringified JSON and give a dictionary object
		> make your own json.loads() function
		> different error handling
		> different layer of validations
		> suggested to make use of {[{}]} valid paranthesis algorithm

3rd round:
	> difference of an image and container
	> questions on docker file, sample docker file to run a python suite
	> how to restrict users to access the docker container
	> container security
	> volumes/bind mounts
	> default network of the docker
	> write a sample kubernetes cluster file for my python app
