	1. definition of container
		In simplest terms, docker containers consist of applications and all their dependencies.
        They share the kernel and system resources with other containers and run as isolated systems in the host operating system.
        The main aim of docker containers is to get rid of the infrastructure dependency while deploying and running applications. This means that any containerized application can run on any platform irrespective of the infrastructure being used beneath.
        Technically, they are just the runtime instances of docker images
	2. docker images
		> They are executable packages(bundled with application code & dependencies, software packages, etc.) for the purpose of creating containers. Docker images can be deployed to any docker environment and the containers can be spun up there to run the application
		
	3. DockerFile
		It is a text file that has all commands which need to be run for building a given image
	4. functionality of a hypervisor
		A hypervisor is a software that makes virtualization happen because of which is sometimes referred to as the Virtual Machine Monitor. This divides the resources of the host system and allocates them to each guest environment installed.
	5. docker compose
		It is a YAML file consisting of all the details regarding various services, networks, and volumes that are needed for setting up the Docker-based application. So, docker-compose is used for creating multiple containers, host them and establish communication between them
	6. docker commands:
		status of all containers - docker ps -a
		start a docker -> docker start NAME_OF_CONTAINER
		start a container -> docker run container_id
		start an interactive container with auto remvove -> docker run -it --rm container_id
		start container in detached mode -d
		push docker image to hub -> docker push
		rename the docker image -> docker tag
		build a local image -> docker build (you need a DockerFile inside pwd, remember keywords of DockerFile)
		list images in local -> docker images
		remove an image -> docker rmi IMAGE_ID
		pull an image from hub -> docker pull
		delete all local images -> docker image prune -a
		find details of a running docker - docker container inspect NAME -> IP address can be used to comms from another container
		
	7. attahced & detached modern
		> run docker container into foregroud mode - logs can be seen in stdout
		> run docker container into backgroud mode - logs cannot be seen 
		> docker attach NAME_OF_CONTAINER/ID  to see the logs occuring
	
	8. docker-compose	-> used to deploy multi containerized apps, read thorugh a sample docker-compose 
							file
						> version, services(container_names), images, volumes, environment variables, networks
		
	9. dockerignore file -> it will not copy mentioned files types into image	
	10. ENV variables in DockerFile
		define in docker file:	
			ENV PORT 10 -> use into python os.environ["PORT"]
			using docker command line -e PORT=8000
			.env file have key=val  use cmd line --env-file
	11. build ARG variables in DockerFile -> comes from user cmd line 
			ARG DEFAULT=90
			;;;;;;;;
			;;;.....
			use DEFAULT somewhere before starting containers
			cmd line --build-arg DEFAULT=30
	12. Docker networking
		www is default access
		docker can connect to host machine/localhost -> use "host.docker.internal" as domain name in python code
		docker network create NAME
		docker run --network NAME, give same name for required containers, domain name will be NAME OF DOCKER COntainer itslef
			like mogodb://MONGODB:21017/xxx
	
	13. Docker bind mounts(mostly used for code changes in local and without building u can get code changes to containers)
		> docker run -it --rm --name dockeredpy  -v "C:\Users\kkothiya\PycharmProjects\dockered_s
	14. Docker copy from container to host
		> docker cp bc34163fa9b2(container ID):/TESTS/smokes/456.txt .\smokes\345.txt(local path)
mokes:/TESTS" pythonimage:7
